Or to a representative of each section in Japan headquarters is responsible for the pull each other or others of the foot, there are more pressing. Than is customer doctor is important the appearance of the in-house. Evaluation of Gilead Japan from the doctor is the worst. Facilities: there is no need to be directly connected to the Japan of the headquarters is the ornate Tokyo Station. It should be transferred to the cheap rents of place.

And it is great to work with several people who have the same mission driven approach and passion for ending HIV."

"Gilead is an excellent place to start gaining experience in the industry. I do not regret coming to Gilead but I am definitely concerned about my future and development at Gilead. I feel like the 80/20 rule of responsibility on mainly the individual in order to develop here is not the correct approach. It should be a 50/50 rule, I am a people manager and I always ask about my staff's career goals, what can I do to help the individuals get to their goals. My manager on the other do not do that so I feel like I am not as invested in this organization."

Additionally, I am very excited at the potential of this company, as the pipeline is very innovative and has potential to change lives of millions of people. I am glad that I work for an organization that strives to provide an option for people struggling with life altering illnesses.

"I enjoy the diverse culture, cultures, and especially the wide range of employee ages. I've worked in other Bay Area companies where all the employees are either very young or very old, and in both of those scenarios the overall culture does not seem to be very effective. The most effective companies I have been affiliated with seem to have, and value, employees of all ages. Gilead seems to have employees from 20 to 75 and all points in between.

I love what we do for people and I am happy to be a part of that. I have been fortunate to grow professionally here (not necessarily at the pace I would like, a little slow) but not everyone has that opportunity. For the most part I feel respected but I also feel due to my tenure here I am held to a different (higher) standard than new employees."

"Being in an area like HIV Marketing for the last 8 years, the rich pipeline has afforded many great launch experiences. However, I will say that the experiences of working at the company when we were smaller/leaner were more conducive to my career development because of the greater responsibility and ownership of projects. There was also a lot less bureaucracy and administrative burden so more of our time was spent on work that made a business impact. I believe I am better suited for work environments that run faster and where nimbleness matters."
"I enjoy the people I work with, including my boss. Also, I think the Gilead has enough opportunities for vertical as well as horizontal growth."

We have bonded and often share stories and improvement opportunities we've had in different companies that are not being applied here. It's fascinating that no matter what company we came from, our experiences were similar and some of the issues/problems we have here would be easily solved in other companies. On another note, I really enjoy the Gilead Live events with Elton John and Alicia Keys. Additionally, I enjoyed the PDM picnic during the summertime, but that has been scrapped for a couple of years now, so that is sad. With regards to benefits, I think that Gilead has good benefits in general."

I also truly believe Gilead does try and do the right thing, it tries to learn from its mistakes and doesn't rush to do things just because others (the market), etc. think its what they should. That to me is strong leadership."
Freedom to operate as I see fit.

It's awesome to be able to run all characterization tests (specifically for lyo - freeze dry microscope, BET surface analyzer, DSC) and great to have data available from powerful process equipment (TDLAS for development lyo). It's as if Gilead recognizes the time savings in development by having these tools onsite :).

It's also great to work for a driven company dedicated to new product launches and able to get regulatory, quality, and development alignment to move projects forward at a quick pace (this is refreshing because I've been places where this didn't happen, and it was a painful part of those experiences).

Finally, I can't tell you how proud I am to work for a company dedicated to cure diseases rather than just manage diseases. Gilead's drive to cure diseases makes me really happy that I work here."

"I have been fortunate to have had the same regional director since day one at Gilead, and now over 5 years later I’ve developed a great realationship with him that has a deep level of trust, respect, and professionalism. Matt Sakatani is an excellent regional director and I’m not sure if I would still be at Gilead if I was reporting to someone else. I have also developed relationships with other employees at Gilead that act as a soundboard for when times are tough. The few chances we get to interact with one another in person (national and midyear meetings) are always great and a morale booster."

"The Gilead QA CMO Oversight team provides opportunities for growth in my career every day. The opportunities to audit and travel are endless if I have time to support that team. Because Gilead QA culture has not been focused on ""LEAN principles"", there are many opportunities to ""close gaps"" and ""process improvement projects"" that can help QA. This is why I believe that Gilead is a great place to work, the work never ends."

Our macrocycles from the Selcia project were the Selcia project were highlighted at recent Drug Discovery Chemistry meeting San Diego as a high quality science (as we were able to redesign natural complex molecule with polypharmacology into a drug like molecule). Unfortunately (as very common at Gilead) there is no need/use of this molecule."

The work is meaningful and interesting and the I like the people I work with.
"I have loved Gilead - so much I can't even put it into words. We have been innovative and tactfully aggressive in our business pursuits with an appropriately high focus on helping people of the world. As a Sales Leader, I have enjoyed that Gilead trusts the experience and judgment of it's leaders and thus, leaves decision making largely in their capable hands. I can feel this changing over time and we should fight to keep pushing decision rights downward to experienced/trusted leaders vs. upwards to centralized functions. This gets harder and harder as an organization grows in size."

Now that I am selling Truvada for PrEP, I once again find myself on the frontline with customers engaging on a high level of cutting edge medicine and it is invigorating!"
Feeling I make a real difference in patient lives. The people who I work with.
I am a Gilead employee who has transferred into the Kite organization. Our Kite employees share the same passion for patient outcomes that I've seen in Gilead employees.

This has been a great place to work and I have great team mates.

Unfortunately many of these opportunities are for individuals based in Foster City if due to family reasons or financial relocation is not possible this can prove a challenge but can be overcome in time as opportunities arise later requiring a person to wait.

Everyone at every level I have encountered is passionate and driven to excellence. I think this comes down from the top, I am very appreciative of the ""state of Gilead calls"" and hope we continue to cultivate this inclusive everyone matters mentality. (I've been in Pharma sales for 17 years at larger and smaller companies than Gilead and the pride in Gilead and collaboration between teams is the best I have ever seen; biggest reason I think my team works harder than any team I've ever been on and even though it's the most challenging market we've ever seen we are all still here because we believe in the company and medications we sell).

"Having the opportunity to work on projects that will reduce humankind's suffering. Many other (bigger, more profitable, more ""sexy"") companies are doing things which change the world but don't help those who are suffering in this world. Gilead products are meant to help those who are suffering. When Gilead does its job, people suffer less. To me that is unique, and means more than creating a new luxury product so that those living well can live even more comfortable lives."
I appreciate the dedication and ownership the other employees show to and through their work here.
Working within the group that I have and absorbing the knowledge that is being passed down. I feel an accomplishment in the work I do even though it may not directly affect the patients we serve.

It really provides an opportunity for me to provide my input and make a difference. I feel that my manager and my immediate team members are collaborative and we can discuss to jointly come up with solutions. No one on our team ""throws anyone under the bus."""

Making work processes more efficient and transparent

Great role models. We have very intelligent strong individuals in ClinOps leadership roles and I feel comfortable following their lead.
Having just completed my first year at Gilead I feel the best part of my experience here is how we seek and find ways to meet unmet medical needs. I have been especially proud of the way the ways we continue to develop new and better treatments and helping the centers that provide treatments. During the last year I have worked with our Medicinal Chemists and have been very impressed with their dedication and understanding of the safety aspects of where they work.
New Therapy that is personal. Great culture.

We are helping people throughout the world.
"Speaking from the TS standpoint of, even while along the company's policy, a way that there was a certain area of ??the environment (discretionary) that has been left."
Work-life balance
"1. The variety, scope, and importance of roles the company has had the confidence to place me in. This has made the experience interesting and dynamic, challenging in a good way, and at times exhilarating, and it has certainly enhanced my own asset value in my career.

Food is good.

My manager/senior leadership are always looking for opportunities for my coworkers and I to learn new things whether that be in-class training, working on something new/different for the company, or being trained on experiments/processes that I personally have never done before. 

Example: Before I started this job, I had a lot of wet chemistry experience, but zero manufacturing experience. Since working at Gilead, I have now traveled to oversee GMP manufacturing as well as worked in our pilot plant."
"The high degree of team-working, all working together to solve problems"

I like the chance to help really sick people with a great product.
"I enjoy regularly collaborating with like-minded, motivated individuals in a team environment. When on a team, I feel like I am respected and my work is appreciated."
In the past the future was exceedingly bright and the sky was the limit but now there is much uncertainty about the products/therapeutics that Gilead plans to deliver including Kite's oncology portfolio. Along with many sr. leaders of the company have left and unsure if this is a sign of their belief in the company or them just moving on to other opportunities for growth. It does excite me for what we do for patients as it is quite amazing but the future does not seem as bright as it was in the past; what happened....seems like we lost our mojo.

Feel I have been (a small) part of something big!

The best part of working at Gilead is the opportunities that my direct manager and colleagues present me. They encourage me to do more and learn more outside of my current position. I would like to move out of my role as an administrative assistant and join a team that does not require scientific knowledge but does require business knowledge.
"Most of the interactions with individuals from different departments, via emails or meetings, are very productive. I also appreciate when people's non-hesitantly ask for my opinion or my help because they value my expertise. Overall, working with very smart individuals who are working together to advance a project is the best part of my experience here"
Opportunity to be involved in different tasks/initiatives.
"I have a great set of co-workers/team-members, who really contribute to a positive working environment and provide a support system.
Gilead provides the techincal tools necessary for me to perform my job quickly and efficiently.
I appreciated the new 'perks' Gilead has been striving to bring go emplyees (commuter buses, high profile perfomers such as Elton John, TED style talks).
I appreciate that my mangaers are open to hearing my recommendations, but unfortunately they don't have the power/senior leadership influenece necessary to push chages forward."
The team I work on is a great team. We get the support from upper management that we need. We have access to the latest and greatest technologies/
When in the previous department the senior manager trusted my capability and allowed me to tackle new tasks and areas very independently.
Working with the research & development teams to understand new area in which Gilead can make an effective change to patient management
The knowledge I've gained of processes run and the operating systems.
"The best part of my experience at Kite has been learning and gaining experience within the cellular therapy space. It's be rewarding to hear of the impact that Kite's therapies have had on patient's lives. I've personally lost several family members from cancer, and I've always wanted to work as close to the patient as possible, knowing that what I did contributed to their well being. 

For a time this seemed to be the case within my organization and Kite overall. However, personal interests of key leaders have begun to surface making it more difficult to do what is best for Kite. There is a pervasive culture of backstabbing and self-interest spreading within Supply Chain. This behavior is not only counter to Kite's values but those of Gilead as well. It's behavior of Supply Chain's leader, Jian Irish and those closest to her, that has set the tone for the group. One where it's about self-interest at the expense of others. The leadership team is largely comprised of Jian's closest colleagues, brought into Kite by herself from Amgen. They seek to isolate counter opinions and when staff express countering opinions they are marginalized. I have witnessed behaviors that call into question ethical and moral misconduct. I personally have questioned them to my management as well to the head of Tech. Ops. There seems to be little concern of the lasting impact of such a lack of integrity. Respect is not provided to those who don't align with narrow interests of those who are within the ""inner circle"" of supply chain's leadership. 

I was pleased to see the value on recognizing and mitigating unconscious bias. Unfortunately, my leadership seems oblivious to the intent of this value. They are so drunk on the thought of their equity balances that they've failed to recognize the consequences of their toxic behavior. Ultimately, if you serve the interest of management, then you will be rewarded otherwise you are treated in an unprofessional manner."
The best part of my experience here is how management is dedicated to improving employee development.

Collaborating with well experienced individuals and the opportunity to advance
"I am proud of Gilead's products and am impressed to work with such a hard-working and talented team of professionals. I work in Legal, and our clients are appreciative of our work product. Most of management leads with a calm presence - which I love. I came from an organization with yellers and a confrontational atmosphere. However, I fear that culture may shift with the recent changes in management. I worry Gilead may not do enough to preserve that aspect of our culture."

The dedicated teams and individuals
"The outstanding senior leadership and exposure to excellence from my RDs and SRDs has been the best part of my experience with Gilead. This has elevated me professionally and personally to a level that I would not have achieved at most companies, and definitely not had I stayed where I was. I feel Gilead is one of the most respected companies in the Pharmaceutical Industry and I feel an enormous sense of pride to say that I represent them."
"I agree with Gilead's patient first approach. Because of this I feel that my efforts are not wasted but go towards a rewarding cause.

I also appreciate the quality of personal at Gilead."
"I have felt empowered to hire and develop my team in the field and in conjunction with my manager. I feel that with the growth I have been able to deliver - my opportunities have also grown in the company. Which includes a recent commercial rotation that I truly enjoyed and felt I contributed to greatly to. As well as my manager's belief in me through participation in Director Development and being a part of a team with the VP of our group. A very important component of the best part are the people both field and internal - Gilead colleagues are (for the most part) the best, and our mission is clear - we work very hard on behalf of the patients! Much of this comes from our leaders down - we see that our Senior Leaders care about the people and the culture which should continue."

I was able to participate as a founding member of a new ERG. This is a once in a lifetime career opportunity and am very grateful for Gilead's new core value of Inclusion in order for employees to come together with similar interests and form these groups.
I feel that I am contributing to the basic goal of benefitting peoples lives through my efforts.
I enjoy working with my direct team and manager very much. It has been exciting launching 4 products in 4 years and changing lives.
"Gilead colleagues excel in their functional areas and they are held accountable. I haven't experienced any ""weak"" link in our team. Everyone is well-versed in their area of expertise. I also have an excellent manager who allows for autonomy, but is always present for guidance and direction."

working with people from different backgrounds and experience and having to learn some knowledge abut what they do for the company
"Two things (beyond the compensation) make it worth coming to work every day: The people I work with, and the people we're helping. I also like that while the job is demanding, it is also flexible and understanding. Efficiency overall as a team is what matters, and that includes making allowances for individuals."
The best part of my experience at Kite is working closely with an innovative therapy that has the potential to help so many people.
"The people I work with. Our cross-functional team is passionate, competent and trustworthy. They respect the contributions I make to the team, and to Gilead, and make me feel like I'm making a difference. Members of the CLT do not operate in this manner. Namely, Head of Medical (Josee) and Legal (Cinda) are constantly and consistently derogatory, combative and condescending. I am reassured by the new members of the CLT (Kevin and Sheila), under Kennet's leadership, that they will make a positive difference to the culture of the organization, and have our employees feel like they should not be afraid of authority."
"Experience in Gilead? -Confusingly worded question?! If it's ""experience working in Gilead"", here is my answer: Gilead is a dynamic, responsive company, which largely treats employees very well and puts the patient at the centre of what we try to do. There are opportunities for further training and Gilead will support employees to continue their education, which is an excellent opportunity."
"Initially it was being part of a team, where my voice and opinions matter. I like the challenging work and learning new areas of my job."

Since we are cross-matrix, many of us attend different SMT teams which provides insights into how various TA are managed - timelines, subject population, regions, etc. It's exciting to be part of mechanism that may change the quality of life of people."
I like the relationships I built with colleagues.
Helping patients to get medicine
The best part of my experience is being a part of successful projects and a company that makes an impact.
Being part of the project that makes it to the market
Working for a leader in hepatitis C.
The great cross-functional teams I have the experience working with on a daily basis.
"I like the people I work with, even on the periphery."
The best part of my experience at Gilead has been the opportunity to work with a variety of people from different cultural and professional backgrounds. These opportunities have challenged me to approach problems differently than I would have otherwise. I have also collaborated with employees from other functional areas on working groups that has allowed me to learn from the experience of others and apply lessons and other best practices to my own project work. Broadly speaking these kind of opportunities have enriched my professional experience at Gilead and have been deeply rewarding from a personal standpoint.
I had hands on experience working on a BLA and EMA submission including post-filing activities.
colleagues and breadth of projects to work on
The best part about my experience at Gilead is being appreciated for what I do.
Expand access to those in need
"Working on five NDAs (Genvoya, Descovy, Epclusa, Vosevi and Biktarvy) within the past six years of being at Gilead (five being a FTE) have been the best learning experiences. It was through these filings that I learned a lot about industry standards vs Gilead standards and what it takes to bring a drug to market. I have developed a solid skillset in submission document processing and publishing that is very rare to see elsewhere. It was also through these submissions that I was exposed to working closely with cross-functional groups that I normally would not work with on daily/routine submissions."
I feel that the work that I do actually matters and that I am contributing to the search for novel therapeutic candidates.
At Gilead Alberta the people are the best part of the experience. Some co-workers can be like family after awhile. Everyone works hard to contribute to bringing drugs to treat/cure life threatening diseases to market.

I personally find this very motivating, excellent for my development"

"I'm trusted with autonomy to build and execute processes that benefit the company. My management encourages me to pursue ideas for improvement or change, and support me working with cross functional areas. I am not afraid to approach my management with issues or concerns."
The autonomy to impact change and execution.
"Working for an organization with a common, noble vision to help patients around the globe."
It is a nice size company with few layers.
My colleagues who provide me with deeper insight and new views of how to approach my territory. Specifically my buddy Kevin Smith and Debbie Hodshon who I run ideas by and scenarios.
"I most appreciate the emphasis on personal/professional growth. I think part of that is my manager's influence -- in our 1:1 meetings, we often discuss my assigned tasks, how those tasks fit into the larger picture, and the learning/growing opportunities that those tasks present. I have learned more in my years at Gilead than I learned in three other companies combined. I think that the fast-paced and exciting environment forces a steep learning curve, and also requires the development of efficient and effective work practices. Due to the knowledge I've gained at Gilead and the way I've learned to apply that knowledge, I feel more confident and comfortable than ever before in my career."
Gilead is an exciting and demanding place to work. The job is engaging and rewarding. The Foster City location is in an area well-suited to family life.
Gilead leadership gives regular updates on what's going with the company and its future roadmap. I feel connected and informed with the company's vision. The commuter bus program is great as it allows employees to commute farther from the very expensive peninsula. The cafeterias are great as they serve various options at a reasonable price. The business unit I support is generally good to work with.
The best part of my experience has been to collaborate with customers' to provide solutions to optimize patient access and improve patient outcomes. I have always been a firm believer that my day to day work with the end customers' (that is NOT always seen by internal Gilead's) results in the most refreshing and rewarding dialogue based on the most significant impact it has on patients lives.
The challenging/interesting work and how smart everyone is.
"My immediate management and team are wonderful. I have learned a tremendous amount from my supervisor and other team members. I am given the flexibility to make my job what I want, for the most part."
"The best part of working at Gilead is working for great leaders. I feel that the leaders above me (Facilities VP and CFO) provide us with the vision, strategy, culture, and empowerment to be part of greater purpose. Having exceptional leaders is a large reason to stay a part of the Gilead family.

On a smaller note, having amenities perks such as commuter buses, exceptional cafeteria services, and open work space layout help in this competitive job market environment."
"Is himself willing to be able to tackle consider the action plan, such as worker-friendly work environment because it has introduced a rational system."
The potential to have an impact on people's lives through finding cures/treatments for diseases through research.
"Being able to work with different teams and study leads and take on new roles or tasks in order to learn new things. And the great benefits (401k, health, ESPP etc)"
"The best part of my experience here are definitely the projects and opportunities to learn and develop new and old skill sets (instrumentation, data analysis, etc.)"
"Working for a company that has a very positive impact on people with HIV and HCV, saving and extending patients lives. Also, working for a financially stable company provides me with a sense of security and stability."
"I'm fortunate to have a great direct manager, who I've learned a lot from in regards to strategically working with cross-functional partners. I also believe our work is meaningful and positively benefits patients, which helps me to feel better about the lack of work-life balance."

"My direct colleagues are the best part of my experience here at Gilead because they always treat me and each other with respect. It's the unscheduled, random communication with my colleagues that I find out more information about a project that I'm working on. For projects that are top priority, most higher lever management will say that something needs to be done urgently (sometimes in a demanding, lack of respect way) without providing the background. This is an issue because some work is done by trust only and if something goes wrong, then senior management will question the subordinates work. I believe that senior management may benefit from better communication (while maintaining respect with subordinates) particularly while dealing with tight timelines."
"Professionally, I really enjoy my job, the responsibilities I carry out, and working with my team, manager, and department. I feel very supported and encouraged to continue to grow and develop.

I feel that Gilead treats their employees very well. The best part of my experience at Gilead in the last 5 years is that I've been promoted 3 times and now have gotten to transfer to a different therapeutic area.

Kite has made me grow in a professional way quickly and efficiently
The training program while somewhat slower paced has been fantastic in ensuring understanding of the techniques and self-confidence prior to deployment. This combined with the open space has facilitated a myriad of interactions that lead to supporting relationships that would normally not be that common in another more closed work environment.
"I would have to say that Kite actually cares for their employees, and listing to any concerns. Hard work is recognized and acknowledged. Management has open door policies that literally stand by that, meaning any time of the day you can pop in and address any questions or concerns.

The best part of my experience here is the learning process. Support and knowledge are apart of the daily service that we provide - One example is how we support cross functional meetings regardless of input and value added in order to increase the knowledge of the organization. Another example includes being a 'warm body' in a room when there is no value input required from the passive group due to a raised complaint of participation (possibly due to misused metrics) - this exemplifies our commitment to rapidly respond to the concerns of our peers and leaders.

The people I get to work with are the most intelligent and driven individuals I've worked with in 15+ years in pharmaceutical industry. It's inspiring to work with such high-performing team members. I learn something new multiple times a day from my colleagues.
My best experience here was while we were working to upgrade our systems 3 years ago and during the process there was a lot collaboration and teamwork. There were many ideas flowing and it seemed like everyone respected each others opinion regardless of what the idea was. I am going through another upgrade process and the environment seems more intense than it was before and it intimidates people from speaking up.
To work on a new and exciting initiative that has amazing potential

I feel like I am making a direct impact on Gilead's mission and I feel like there is ample room for me to grow in my career.
The best part of my experience is working oncross-functional teams. I work on several projects that involve various groups within the department to help ensure alignment for end to end standards implementation. I believe this is extremely important so that we are able to be more efficient as a company as well as be able to adapt to future regulatory changes.
Meeting new people and making friendships.
Gilead's mission
The development opportunities I have received and a 'can do' attitude
"I like the flexibility of hours and places I can work from when necessary. The benefits Gilead offers gives me a peace of mind (e.g. health insurance, life insurance, etc...) I like that my manager is not a micro-manager. I feel comfortable discussing my concerns with my manager."
Supportive manager and team.
"The best part of my experience here is learning from extremely talented people I work with. Gilead does a great job of hiring talented individuals at all levels, so I have felt privileged to be a cross functional partner and share ideas on how we an achieve company goals and continued to stay align to our vision/mission."
"Knowing that the work we do here on a daily basis, has such a positive impact to people across the world. I enjoy helping others, and what better way to do so, than to help those who have no control over their situations. We are constantly reminded, that the little things we do here play an important role in the outcome of our medicine. So when we work on larger pieces of equipment, that just means that we need to really pay attention to details and knowing that we make a difference is what I find to be the most rewarding to myself."
The company culture is incredibly good at encouraging both individual and team growth as new employees learn the process and experienced employees further optimize established processes and help to develop and refine new endeavors.
I enjoy building relationships internally and externally. I feel like my colleagues know that I believe in what we do and say.
my colleagues and opportunity to learn
"Working with people who are smart and who care, both about their work, the patients, and doing what's best for the people that work with and for them."

Being given a greater level of autonomy and responsibility and being compensated for it in a lot of different ways.
N/A
The best part of my experience here is sitting in on patient panels to see how my work directly impacts real patients. Another best part is the Gilead Live series in which we get to hear from respected figures that help motivate me.
My management and group.
Having the opportunity to help discover new drugs which will benefit patient's lives
the autonomy to co-manage my own geography and build long-term relationship with my customers
Working with the people here and getting a lot of project management experience that I wanted which is why I wanted to work here in the first place.
"1. Working with team members from diverse backgrounds is the best part of my experience. Our team has medical, public health, and policy experts who bring unique perspectives. When I first started, most of my work was in isolation without much interaction with my team members. There was a culture of minimal collaboration and it seemed mostly competitive. As we have grown, the culture is changing and we are recognizing the value of collaboration to drive success for everyone on the team. I attribute this mostly to the new leadership.
2. Hearing from executive leaders about the company vision and goals is the next best experience. During our All Hands meeting, Gregg Alton is always inspiring and motivates me to stay focused on the larger goals despite the many challenges we may face in the field. As a field employee, it can be easy to feel disconnected from the larger organization and get buried in my work in my region. These meetings and interaction with the larger team remind me of the innovative and dedicated leaders we are fortunate to work under as well as the many people around the globe we serve."
"potential for impact
focus on transformative therapeutics vs. incremental outcome"
I am new to Gilead (less than 2 months) but I like the atmosphere of a work environment where people treat each other like members of a community. There is collegiality and collaboration among the different functional areas.
"The people. The people in my department are professional, adheres to the core values and are open to supporting each other."
The best part of my experience at Gilead is the satisfaction of being in an organization that ultimately helps patients.
Working in a lab with top of the line equipment and the resources we need to accomplish any task.
Working in a collaborative environment and learning the responsibilities of other cross-functional areas outside of my own responsibilities in Clinical Operations. The flexible work environment has been extremely paramount in work/life balance.
Collaborating with different teams & the company benefits are great.
1) Working on initiatives that impact the greater GSI community. 2) Collaborating with cross-functional team members 3) The availability of ERGs 3) Having company shuttle bus service to bring me to work.
helping patients
Being part of an innovative company that is providing patients with a treatment alternative not available before.
"Everybody is very nice and respect each other. The non competitive environment helps me to be more comfortable in interacting with coworkers. At the same time, we helps each other to thrive and bring out the best of ourselves."
Professional development specific to long term career goals are being accomplished.
"As an overview Gilead is a great company to work for and all of the initiatives in terms of providing opportunities. Love Gilead working culture, benefits and opportunities for growth and success. People are nice to work with one caveat, that information from senior management probably is not always shared that is relevant either in terms of projects or growing opportunities."
The goals and passion of the company and its employees is something I stand with. I feel Gilead employees are intelligent and raise all colleagues to a high level of expertise. The work/life balance is great as well.
the people i work with
"Working with talented people who are committed to the end goal. Strong teamwork and collaboration and highly rewarding files - HCV cure, healthy aging in HIV, transformative cell therapy and entry into new treatment space with NASH all highly impactful for patients and very motivating to work on."
The disease state that I work in and my field colleagues. My rotation experience was so fun and mentally stimulating. It gave me a greater appreciation for the support the field has from the home office.

To be able to work with very smart and enthusiastic team leading the path to cure cancer.
The best part of working at Gilead is to have opportunities to contribute and develop along with the company growth.
Developing life saving medicines use state of the art science and trying to make sure they are available to all regardless of who they are.
The best part of my experience at Gilead is working within a group who appreciates opinions from all levels of the organization. I've been able to solve problems within my department with little to no supervision. I have also been able to work on very diverse projects both within and outside my group. The diversity in my job is what keeps me working at Gilead.
"The best part of my experience at Gilead Sciences is the constant learning opportunity. As a new employee last year, I was inexperienced in the field of medicinal chemistry and as a synthetic chemist. When I began in March of 2017, my manager took an active role in making sure I learned on job. Books and study guides and learning material were provided to me so that, I could study them so that I could begin to make significant contributions to the medicinal chemistry department. This learning aspect was the best part of working at Gilead . And I continue to learn and develop my skills so that I may make significant contributions to the chemistry department"
"Working in a team, expanding the scope of activities, training.
The ability to make decisions independently and bear responsibility for this"
"My work environment is one that is centered around working as a team and that allows everyone’s talents to flourish.

I don't mind working during weekend meetings or conferences. It is surprising what ideas 'pop' up when you least expect it.
It's best to be part of LATAM bring innovative products to patients.
"The best part of my experience is my sense of fulfillment in my work. The job is tough, but I do feel that in the end it is for a good cause that can potentially help many people."
I have the pleasure to interact with scientists from different expertise and be able to learn from them about drug development while working on projects with them.
Teamwork within my department as well as cross functional
"The people. The staff is the best part of this company. 
The technology. Gilead and Kite cure patients of horrible diseases. It's truly amazing to a part of this on-going effort to save and improve patient's lives as well as their loved one's."
"The best part of my experience at Gilead is seeing the impact of my work on underserved communities. When I have the opportunity to interact with patients living with or at risk for HIV, and I see the work Gilead is doing to improve their lives, I am motivated and inspired."
"I enjoy the team that I work with, who are highly motivated, enthusiastic and intelligent. We support each other. I believe that the core therapeutic areas we work in are motivating. Having the chance to work on areas like HIV, HCV and HBV are meaningful to me personally and professionally. We maintain a strong commitment to global health."
"My value being recognized by managers and having the opportunity to participate in important tasks. For example, having the opportunity to lead the most complicated HCV wave 4 POLARIS-1 study, and having the opportunity to perform the simulation evaluation for NASH STELLA phase 3 program."
I really enjoy the independence I get and the support of my manager. I really feel that our work style really works for me which allows me to enjoy my job more.

Best Experience is the team work and working towards a goal in collaborative way.
Management is very supportive and encourage us to give our input to our work process. Department staff are very friendly and easy to work with.
Collaborating as a team to get things done.
Team commitment and speed of decision making when it is important and necessary
"Relatively small company that can move quickly. People are generally trying to do the right thing, not a very political environment."
"good benefits, career trainings, smart colleagues"
The best part of my experience working in Gilead is the being a part of a patient-centric company. I greatly value that Gilead is always driving to benefit patients regardless of outside opinions or news. It's inspiring to be a part of a company that cares so much.
My manager and the company allow me to be myself
I am able to relate my daily work to Gilead's impact on improving patient's life. That makes my job very rewarding.
"We are motivated to make a difference to patients, and progress is quick enough that we know we do make a difference."
"The best part of my experience at Gilead is the willingness of my colleagues to help out with basically anything. Whenever a question is raised, one will always try to help or put me into contact with someone who can."
"Opportunities to develop in my career, promising pipeline with interesting/new targets, good benefits"
"Gilead takes care of their employees, providing benefits and rewards for hard work through a gift or a great musical performance. The work is hard and it makes you challenge yourself but it is rewarding to know you are helping others improve their health and their life."

being able to live with the science from development to a marketed product
"Cross-functional enthusiasm, motivation, and collaboration to work hard and accelerate timelines of drug development as much as possible!"
"My function is very immature relative to best in class.

The second best part of my experience is that I can take a constant level of pride in being a small part of a company that's impact is aligned to my personal values (helping others, making the world a better place)."
"I have a manager, and really, our immediate team, who trust me to do my job and I feel that they all want me to succeed. Which in turn I want to work harder because I don't want to disappoint them."
I remember as a little kid that My family told me we were gling to disneyland and I couldnt sleep for the enitire week because I was just so excited to go. When I got there ot was everything I imgained and more and Once we left I couldnt wait to go back. Kite a Gilead company is my new Disneyland.

"Excellent direct report, great work environment."
The best part of my experience is my team. We all work and collaborate so well together!
High Quality cross-functional partners.
I feel very comfortable talking to my manager and director. They have a great open door policy that allows me to communicate with them regarding any issues.
My manager and Team are supportive and encouraging of each other.
"- Learning about how the pharmaceutical industry works in different departments and our impact on patients. 
- Attending a conference and learning how others in the same field conduct their work at their companies. This opportunity to network in the conference was invaluable. 
- Engaging with auditors and answering their questions. 
- The freedom and flexibility that I get from my supervisor to conduct my work and to make my own decisions. The trust my supervisor has in me to complete my work on time and well is very important to me."
"Having worked at other companies, the level of top down communication is very refreshing and appreciated. As a field sales representative, you will never get up to the minute news, but this is as close to it, as I’ve ever experienced. I hope that no matter how large this company becomes, that raw communication is something that never wavers."
I feel Gilead tries to be competitive in the marketplace with the benefits it offers employees. The ERG's and Gilead Live events have really added a new dimension to inclusion and
Some SAS macros improves the work efficiency greatly.

 The organizations for social responsibility projects began to increase the awareness of our company."
"The people, I look forward to most meetings just to get their perspective, so many talented individuals."
"I think Gilead as a company really knows how to treat their employees! From the wide variety of trainings we offer, to weekly happy hours, to Summer Picnic and holiday parties, I feel that Gilead keep their employees happy and feeling valued by offering all of these great benefits. I also think the many ERGs and sponsored events like AIDS Walk, etc. really make a difference."
Autonomy to develop my own projects and teamwork to work cross functionally to deliver them
Quick to get broad and deep responsibilities in a lean organization and on a small teams. In (few) select areas we have good people and strong immediate management. Gilead is a resume builder.
"There are alot of opportunities presented and accessible for growth and movement. The ability to take on projects working with cross functional teams, allows for greater exposure and learning enhancement."
Knowing the positive impact this company makes in many lives.
The supportive culture
doing great science on exciting disease indications
"I enjoy being part of an organization that has developed products that has significant impacts on improving patients lives and health outcomes. We give our patients hope. I also love that Gilead is a California based corporation that fosters (no pun intended) diversity and equality for all. I really enjoyed the opportunity building Kite, but I am equally proud to be part of the Gilead team."
The people I work with on a daily basis are fantastic and the progress we are making in developing life saving treatments is amazing.
"Being able to make a difference for the patients. Personally, having continuous discussions with my manager for opportunities and career development."
I like knowing that we help patients with medical needs.

Collaboration during the investigation.

The people I work with; everyone works hard and I believe everyone works with integrity and excellence.
Gilead promotes cross-functional growth opportunities which allows employees to learn new processes and functions.
"Research project teams are highly effective and functional. When a goal is established, teams are challenged to do what ever it takes to push a product forward in a rapid manner and to address challenges head on. Research teams are reviewed 3 times a year which enables regular feedback. Teams are highly committed and adopt a positive can-do attitude, are inclusive and innovative. Gilead understand that great things happen when you empower cross-functional teams."
Feeling like I can accomplish my goals.
Working along side with my team members
My colleagues within my team are very helpful and collaborative.
1) The quality of the people I work with at Gilead. 2) The flexibility to accommodate work/life balance. 3) The opportunities for career growth.
"The freedom and enablement to be creative and self starting. Specifically the limited bureaucracy when acquiring materials I need to do my job effectively, and the turn around time when reaching out for help in other departments. In addition, the transparency in management makes me feel like I have the freedom to contribute at a high level rather than just robotically towing the line for another's goals. This makes me feel like I am included in the vision of my project and more broadly the vision of the company, and it makes my contributions feel more meaningful."
The best part of my experience here is having my leadership supports. We face difficult simulations everyday. I feel that I always can come to my manager's office if I have any questions or need any guidance from her.
Having opportunities to continually develop and learn so that it always keeps the job interesting and keeps me motivated.
"Working with great people to advance life-saving therapeutics, and being given great opportunities to grow and develop and my skills."

Reward for performance and when performing well you can see a direct correlation with income
I appreciate the supportive environment and strong sense of purpose people have at Kite.
The people and different perspectives
It is very rare for a company to have a profound impact on my as an employee but I found the Bias training to be an honest but sincere opportunity to make better decisions in my work life. Bias training helped me to understand what is Bias and what forms does it come. The big solution was identifying and practicing bias training. The workshop was tremendous but conceptually is was a really valuable component of my employment. Not only am I pursuing all of my work objectives but long-term I am able to become more precise on company needs when hiring or just engaging with other people in our units. Effectively the training stripped us down to our rudimentary parts and gave real insight into moving forward in my employment based on paradigm to reduce bias. What a tool?
Gaining and utilizing knowledge.
The best part of being at Gilead is the REAL opportunity to improve millions of peoples lives by developing new therapies. I love that I have colleagues that feel the same way and work at a company that has already shown that they can do this.
"1) Maintaining close collaborations with colleagues with whom I worked closely when Gilead was a growing and smaller organization. 

2) The ability to think two steps ahead and strategically about Gilead's needs.

3) The ability to collaborate and communicate effectively without formal processes, because it is the right thing to do.

4) Having impact internally and externally.Shaping and creating the environment that will allow the company to thrive."
"Clinical DP team shows great team work in my experience here. Not only we work in a team setting, when different subteams need help due to the work load, everyone else will jump on to help each other out. We work in the mind set of if one of us fail, all of us are not doing a good enough job, and that we will suceed together when we have team work."
work on projects/drugs which later enter into the clinic and approved to improve patient's life
The big picture perspective of the company's mission motivates me. I truly believe that Gilead will continue to make big impact in critical diseases.

My manager seems fair and respects each person individually."

Working passionately with talented colleagues who share that passion

The best part of my experience is my development and being able to take classes to further my productivity skills and overall skill set.

Learn how to look at the bigger picture when solving problems."

The feeling of being supported is such a great motivation."
See our works contribute to advancing knowledge in disease and effectiveness of our drugs
"1. The people. The people I work with in my direct department are some of the most friendliest, knowledgeable, and dedicated people at Gilead. Our department doesn't get the opportunity for much recognition but the work we do, directly contributes to our organization's mission. The level of integrity and accountability here in this department is unmatched. It is a pleasure to come to work everyday working with a department like this. 
2. Gilead's Mission. It is not likely to come across a company has a great mission and can stand by it full throttle. In the short span of time I have been working here, I have managed to collect at least 10 lucites that show how far we've come to reach our mission. I feel a sense of pride knowing that the company I work for is working hard to reach its' goals."

I feel comfortable asking any of my team members a question and know they will genuinely do their best job to help find me an answer. There are no overbearing feelings of competition here even though we are all hard-working and do what needs to be done. In short, the best part of my experience at Gilead has been working for my manager and working with my colleagues."
The core values as a guide to our working environment. Solid guide for making decisions

I feel that I am trusted and valued to do my job without having to be micro managed.
Gilead employees are inclusive.
The opportunity to do challenging work and expand on the scope of experience.
The best part of working at Gilead is that I do feel that my work is making a direct impact in patients' lives. I appreciate that Gilead has several outreach programs that make our drugs accessible to everyone. I also trust that Gilead does in fact find solutions to unmet medical needs.
The company has great contribution to the society and I am proud.
Getting the opportunity to work on a trial from start to finish and have the drug be approved by FDA.
Ranexa is a very unique and interesting drug to sell. Reps are compensated well for sales.
opportunity to have contribution to discover new drugs in the areas of unmet medical needs that improve patient care.
"The best part of working at Gilead is the opportunity to build new everyday. Especially in anticipation of new products coming down the pipeline, there has been a great opportunity for some people to get people involved in pre-launch work and therefore stretch skills that they would not normally have. As it continues to be a relatively small pharmaceutical company, you get much exposure to a broad range of departments. It's a great opportunity to get exposed to different parts of the business and to step forward with your career interests and inform of your strengths to be leveraged for such projects. 
Additionally, Gilead has a strong Purpose that leads to exciting drug launches - ones that make a difference in patients lives. We need to continue to stay close to patients and their stories to remind our colleagues of this."
Positively impacting patients' health and well-being.

Fantastic products
Being part of an organization whose primary focus is helping improve the lives of others
"The level of trust that Liam has in the members of the team to do their jobs as they see fit is the best part of my experience here. Management doesn't always have faith in their employees to do anything without their direct input, but Liam has complete faith in his team."
Learning the different products and how it helps those that are in need of the medication.
Learning new technologies and information.
"Personal and professional development opportunities related to: 
Women in Gilead, women in Science, mentor and mentee opportunities, collaborative culture with lots of open conversations across different functions."
Career development is giving a lot of importance. In my area the management supports the skills and professional development activities by encouraging the colleagues to go for trainings and conferences that are paid by the department to advance their skills.
Working here at Kite is allowing me to get to know myself better as an employee. I am able to better distinguish my working style and build skills for my career.
"I really enjoyed working at Gilead when I just joined the company because I felt empowered, got involved in multiple projects, and felt challenged in term of skill level."
"After a few years, I have finally gotten the opportunity to advance."
I really like the diversity of employees at the company.
That you have the power to make decisions at your level. Accountability at lower levels within the organization. It is what separates us from other companies in the industry. We tend to move swiftly with changes.
I have no pods to deal with.
"I feel appreciated of my works and my suggestions are always welcome by the team. I really feel like I am part of the team.
I also like that we have subsidized lunch as well as commuter bus programs."
"The best part of my experience here is knowing your work results in improving patients' lives Our roles and impact effect so many people in the world and each day knowing this is very exciting. I also enjoy the smart, detailed, and drive my fellow employees have in accomplishing goals."
"Having my manager support me through any issues or concerns that I bring up. Having a team who I can count on in covering for me when I am out of the office. To know that my schedule is flexible enough which allows me to attend school at night. Some of the benefits that Gilead provides like free fruit, G-thanks and Values of Work recognition, Gilead Passport Card, discount with cell phone provider, Employee & Family day, Holiday Party (and be allowed to bring my partner), Lucite/gift distribution, Gilead gear, teambuilding outings, the panel/people being brought in to speak, and to be given a voice and have it be heard by upper-management is the tip of the iceberg in making my experience great here at Gilead."
"The best part of my experience has been the ability to switch groups and learn about new areas and get a better understanding of how the various groups interact and rely on each other. I also enjoy providing training in the areas I am interested in and have practical experience (GCPs, GMPs, GLPs, Process Validation for Downstream Processing, Equipment Qualification, Industrial Column Chromatography regulatory requirements, and any Med Tech (Clinical Laboratory Scientist) related subjects."
"Meeting lots of different people and connecting at all levels of the hierarchy. Cross functional teams and engaging in meaningful, high level conversations with competent people is my favorite part of the day."
"The people, teams and autonomy. The people on my teams are smart, open-minded and fun to work with. They will engage in debate and then circle around a decision. Most of our project decisions can be made within the project team. We can move more quickly because our teams have this autonomy"
Diverse portfolio of products.
"Working with people who have a passion for improving lives. The teams also have a degree of integrity which means alot to me. Work life balance has improved over the past year also. The changes made over the last 3 years has been a huge improvement notably the day care subsidy, commuter bus service and Van service around campus."
"I have been rewarded for my performance,"
Always being challenged professionally and finding optimal solutions to those problems. Having the ability to work with cross-functional SMEs internally and at other Gilead sites.

Learning new things that I haven't learn before.

"Working with really good people. 
Working on life saving drugs."
"I enjoy working at Gilead mainly because of the work that Gilead do, always coming up drugs with unmet needs . I enjoy leading my dedicated team who are always willing to go extra mile to get the work done keeping quality in mind and knowing that what we do matters to patients and for our own personal achievement . I enjoy how we strive thru our day to day challenging situations at Gilead"
"For the most part, everyone has a positive, helpful attitude. It feels like we're a team. That sounds cliché but it's harder to accomplish that than you think. I've worked places where people were always trying to ""catch you doing something wrong"" so they could look better."
"Meaningful projects with a sense of urgency that challenge me, draw the best out of people, and encourage the team to pull together. A specific example is coming up with the theory and practical means of calculating turnover more accurately."
"I think the best part of my experience here at Gilead, is having the sense that we are all working in concert for a larger good. Especially in Research, the collaboration between fellow researchers is rewarding when we appreciate each others insight and expertise."
"Working on cutting edge technologies, focusing on company's as well as personal career goals"
Science is very challenging and interesting. People in the groups work in a very collaborative manner
"Gilead has a very collegial atmosphere. Even when everyone is very busy, they are always friendly and helpful."
"As part of the national analytics and forecasting team for HIV and PrEP I get to work on real-time, impactful, and challenging business questions. This allows me to continue to better understand the market and think of ways to provide accurate and robust answers to questions to drive Gilead's business."
"Great teamwork, people are always willing to rally together and work well to address tough challenges.
I've been fortunate to have been able to directly contribute to most of our companies approved products. I don't think I could have had this opportunity at any other company."
Relationships and networks I have created during my 13yrs at Gilead.
"In all roles and departments I've worked in at Gilead, I've always been supported when proposing innovative ideas or solutions to challenges. In addition, after demonstrating skill sets and abilities, I've always been supported to take on more scope and responsibility in that role. The appropriate balance of resources and work that Gilead strives for enables people to take on more, grow, and broaden responsibilities when you have the vision and desire to do so."
Developing many skills beyond the job description of my title
"Active participation and leadership on several impactful regulatory, clinical, and discovery teams of bright, talented, and motivated people"
Supportive environment for continued education. Feeling comfortable putting forth ideas (as simply as they may be).
Being highly motivated each and every day with the work we do at Gilead.
The work I do. Working in the lab and solving problems on many different projects that affect many people's lives. Many different projects and problem solving.
"I respect Gilead's core values and how they are executed across all levels of the organization. There are many exciting developments happening and exciting, intelligent, creative and professional people who plan and execute on these developments. I am highly motivated by my colleagues and the leadership at Gilead. Ultimately, I think if we hire and retain people with our core values in mind, that Gilead will remain an outstanding place to work."
I feel highly motivated by the vision that the entire Gilead organization represents and the positive impact on patients that we as a company have achieved and will achieve in the future.
"Compelling work, collegiality."
There are many opportunities for career and self advancement.
I enjoy the work pace here as things are moving forward fast and efficiently. I had a steep learning curve and a lot of accumulated knowledge.
"In my department, we have about 7 functions. The best aspect of these functions is that I feel comfortable to reach out to anyone in these functions. I have never been turned around and I love collaborating with each function."
Team work is very important. In our department there are many associates to lend a helping hand. It is also very satisfying to accomplish a work order or a project and see the smile on fellow associates faces.
Great pipelines
"I would say the best part of my experience here is the challenge of my perseverance. Working in the intense environment Gilead offers truly tests one's dedication. To be specific, the workload expected of one person is unsustainable. I have been here for about five years now and although some of the resources have improved, the mindset of the company overall is still that of a small business - where an individual is expected to carry multiple 'hats' (if you will)."
Diversity in job responsibilities. I enjoy the many aspects of my job and the ability to move with the project and product as it develops.
"The best part of experience here is the opportunities offered to me by me director level management. My director has recognized areas that I can utilize the skills, experience and education that I have to bring greater value to our department."
Working with and developing my team. Experiencing a direct and successful impact on team development.
"Impact in patients lives
FOCUS in therapeutic areas that position us better to do a more impactful work"
"Working together to solve the key problems that advance the project forward. For example, many project teams are faced with improving potency or the pharmacokinetic properties of their lead compounds. So when an interesting solution is found, we rally around it, understand it better and try to move one step closer to advancing it as an RFD."
Scientifi cwork in area I enjoy
"I appreciate that I work with a team of smart, dedicated and impressive individuals, and that I have an opportunity to work on projects that are challenging."
"The program I am working on is at the beginning stages, and it is a very interesting collaboration with the NCI. I feel the work we are doing is ground-breaking and I believe we will learn a lot from the patients that are being treated. I couldn't ask for a more interesting project to be part of."
The team I am on. Everyone is very good at their job and willing to help others.
co workers
"I have a great department and management structure that really supports us in doing what we can to work effectively. I do believe Gilead has focused, for the most part, on treatments that have a chance to be transformative and to meet significant unmet medical needs, and has really tried to make our medicines available in the developing world, both areas that give me a good sense of purpose and pride in what we do."
"My roles and responsibilities have changed significantly over the past few years. I've been allowed to take on new challenges, learn new technologies, and guide the way our labs in Southern California utilize these technologies in the lab. The journey has led to development of many new and transferable skills that make me feel more confident in my value. Specifically, I've been able to contribute db queries and code to various ongoing development projects (e.g., LES-IM/LES-ME protocols, metrics and dashboard sites produced in Spotfire, custom sites used internally within SD QC, etc.); have reviewed others' work and been able to identify issues before they surface in validation/production environments; and have participated in the design, maintenance and approval of new systems."
I enjoy working with a lot of the people in the department.
"Scientific, technical and data driven decisions with meaningful deliverables, actions (if required) etc.
Very collaborative and inclusive culture,enabling flexibility and ability to move forward quickly
The importance of what we are doing (curing cancer) and how we make it happen, is always a key focus enabling manufacturing Investigations to be handled with strong sense of urgency and commitment to get product to patient ASAP and with as limited delay as possible"
The cross-collaboration with other departments. Having input from other areas creates better processes and systems and helps to minimize potential downstream issues.
"Being able to work on interesting projects, projects of great significance, and building relationships with colleagues"
"I feel that Gilead does it best to retain and take care of its employees from salary, benefits, and re-training people instead of laying off."
Being a new employee I was impressed that my manager encouraged me to take time to develop relationships with my team and extended team which really helped me build a foundation to work with them.
The best part of working here has been collaborating with a variety of teams.
Working with colleagues and contributing in a team environment.
Company vision. Having a positive impact on patient's lives.
"The scientists I've met at Gilead are some of the best in the industry, and it is a priceless opportunity for me to learn from them and their experiences."
"The best part of my experience is working with the people in the Liver Disease Business Unit. Overall, the team is very motivating and willing to share ideas so that we can all be successful."
"Great company to work for, great manager, selling an important drug."
"I've been in a number of roles during my time at Gilead. In each role, I've gained invaluable experience either through hands-on work in the laboratory, working with contract organizations, and by cross-functional collaboration. I've learned there are many resources available at our fingertips to help us learn and strive to always be better at what we do. And I've learned that Gilead, as an organization, puts the patients first. We are constantly trying to break our own records and to outdo our own medicines to bring the best therapies to patients around the world."
"Collaboration across business units to accomplish a similar goal. The overall teamwork element and willingness to help others is strong throughout many parts of the organization. Gilead's mission to advance therapeutics to treat unmet medical needs, particularly Hep C cure and cancer treatment."
The best part is the passion nearly all the employees have for our mission - to cure cancer. Employees at Kite want to do the right thing for patients and work hard to ensure this occurs. People here are also smart (especially so in early days at Kite). It's been fun and a privilege to work here.
I feel a great honor and commitment to be a part of Kite of our mission to cure cancer.
Working in Filgotinib UC study.
as a newer employee i love what the company is doing to empower its employees.
"People have innovative scientific ideas, they are aware of latest and upcoming new technologies. They are up to date with the current process knowledge which other leading biopharmaceutical companies are following. We have platform to share knowledge and opinion."
I feel fortunate to have witnessed the successful development of a CAR-T cell therapy product. I am also interested in seeing the cell therapy program expand to include more treatments for other oncology indications.
"Working with innovative and committed individuals who want to help patients...I see examples everyday: For example, patients are unable to pay for our drugs get free drugs worldwide."
I always feel encouraged and supported by my Direct Manager and SRD.
It’s the great people I work with and making a difference
I like being responsible for my own territory. I like my manager and we work well and communicate well. I trust that Gilead makes great business moves and I am confident in the future of the company.
I thoroughly enjoy the people that I get to work with here at Gilead. I think the group that I work with on a day-to-day basis pushes me to not only learn more and broaden my knowledge each day but to solidify the knowledge that I already posses.
Mentoring and assisting new hires or providing strategies to assist in their growth
The best part of my experience is working with close team who works well together.
Opportunities to learn and be involved in all aspects of trial design and conduct.
"I have opportunities to develop my knowledge, skills, and relationships through training, work load, and team work."
I was able to launch life changing HCV products.
I am learning a great deal and I like the small sub-group in which I work.
"The team that I am in - collaborative, smart team to be part of"
The ability to work with my immediate team and the work we do to support our field sales team.
"I really enjoy the high caliber of professionalism and team spirit that most employees share. My manager, while demanding high standards, is very supportive and helpful towards achieving goals."
"I believe that my co-workers are very encouraging and I've enjoyed working with them. My current manager, Jane Crane is one of the best managers that I've had at Gilead. She expects my best and is willing and able to work with me, to achieve my goals as well as the companies. Jane works just as hard as she expects her team to work and she maintains open and honest communication. She also treats everyone the same."
The people and the products.
My direct team that works with me.

 I found the chance to work with both Turkey Gilead't management, more than came together with the inauguration of our new general manager participating in the session we can get more chances to express promise we will find ourselves more. We have a chance to establish direct contact with any subject itself. Personally my previous job experience and group work my point of view I did not have a chance in such an environment. I can express myself work in the business environment and to feel that I regarded myself makes me feel more valuable. That's why this difference created by Lady Patricia, a fieldworker and a situation that motivates me to be very valuable for me.

"Learning how to overcome challenging managers, colleagues and systems. Having had the opportunity to work with Neda Fathi, Clinical Trial Manager who left Gilead a few months ago. She was an excellent trial manager, colleague and friend.

"Within my job, I am interacting with a lot of various people and functions and my work is quite scientific in content. My work also include strategic thinking which I appreciate.

I feel Gilead is open to develop their employees. Indeed, since I am at Gilead I have ask to my manager(s) to work on specific projects to increase my knowledge and my technical skills (medical writing, ROW, other specific project within RA) and if the opportunities arisen, I have always been able to work on these projects.

Furthermore, I like that we are given the possibility to work on initiative groups which allows us to work on another matter outside of our day to day job, and to work with new people.

Finally, I really like that we are not fixed to a particular task in Gilead. Within my role I am working on a broad range of activities from development to post-approval work. My role is not only fixed to one activities such as PIP, or clinical trial, or variations... like in other companies."

"Multiple learning opportunities from my colleagues in different departments with diverse backgrounds and specialties. Having a closely knit project team environment makes a difference interactively compared to the more spread out and distant members. Also, having someone like Adrienne Shannon as an HR rep to consult with was critical for the well being of many of us. She took the time to understand our needs and concerns objectively, so we could be very open with her. I hope her successor makes a similar outreach effort to the research community."

So far my team has been so wonderful and as well as my manager
The best part of my experience here is that there is a lot of opportunity. I have been fortunate to grow my career here and be exposed to challenging projects/tasks that expand my knowledge. I started out very entry level here at Gilead and now I am in a more specialized role. What is good and bad about Gilead is that there is a never ending supply of work and projects so there is definitely the opportunity to diversify your experience with stretch roles/projects. My immediate team is also very smart and are experienced in their field of expertise so it has been very helpful in learning as this was a new role for me. I also really enjoyed the new Gilead LIVE segments because being in a field of the business where we do not directly touch the science - it's good to still see the impacts of our work and how they may indirectly relate to the science and improving lives.

"The GLearn HR course is a good examples of how the company is committed in professional and person development. 

The company's efforts in fostering inclusion and diversity views. It may take a while for employees who have been at GSI for a longtime to get used to the idea but I believe that it'll take hold eventually. 

The (funded) ERGs and other interest groups are also great additions for employees to explore other interests within the GSI outside of their work responsibilities."
"The best part is the friends I have made, although the vast majority of them have now left for other jobs and I hope to join them as soon as I can. Honestly the environment here is just so toxic.

You can't even rely on people to show up for work and do their jobs; there are so many that take convenient sick days when they are scheduled for tasks they don't like."

Our leadership has continued to acknowledge that lack of inclusion is pervasive in all spheres of our work/life and requires individual focus and tools to tackle. Be it for thought, gender, race, etc.
- The senior leadership are absolute rockstars in my organization and all partner organizations I have worked with thus far. It is a joy and treat to have such strong leaders who lead by example.

Second, I came here because I firmly believe that Gilead is committed to preventing and curing disease - not just treating it. During my five months here, nothing has swayed me from this belief. The company's culture, mission, and commitment to bettering lives makes coming to work every day exciting and motivating."
"Industry, mission (saving lives), coworkers"
My best part of the experience is that this company give me the opportunity to learn a lot.
The best part is the fact that I feel connected with not only my department but also with Gilead as an organization.
Being able to work with multiple cross-functional teams in a very collaborative manner
The best part is feeling accomplished everytime I leave work knowing that I help move the therapy along the process so that the patients get them safely and on time.
Job is quite secure. Financially the company is still strong. No risk of workforce reduction at this moment. Plenty of projects that we are working on.
"Gilead is inclusive and has a great working environment, clear job responsibilities, appropriate amount of flexibility"
the culture
"Being surrounded by many talented, passionate, hard working people...I learn something new every day."
Been part of the growing company and see the product you working on for four years been approved for treating patients.
In general working with the various folks here at Gilead Sciences. There are many motivated and intelligent people here who want to progress programs and collaborate with other functional areas.
"I'm thrilled by the Gilead Live sessions especially Alicia Keys! This is motivational, exciting and helps to remind me what Gilead's overall impact is and that I am an important contributor."

"Working on products that have made significant impact on patients' lives, particularly in strong and efficient cross-functional teams"
"The most memorable experience that I have gained at Gilead would be are face to face meeting with our CRO. We prepared presentations as well as planned events for our CRO to participate in. It was great getting to see faces that we would never get to see. 

Another great experience would be traveling for work. I recently flew to Kansas City to meet with a CRO for TMF review. It was amazing to see different cultures and perspectives coming from our CRO."
Patient focused development efforts driving innovation and achievement. Ability to work on development of novel therapeutics/therapeutic strategies that have a substantial/meaningful impact on the lives of others. Knowledge that Gilead works to accelerate access of front-line therapeutics to less developed regions of the world.

Gilead's strong commitment and adherence to its core values is of great importance to me; I feel proud to work for such a great organization!"
Working with and learning from vast amount of knowledge and knowledgeable people
"Any time that I can learn about the work that Gilead is doing or the impact we are making in the world, I feel re-energized. I really enjoy State of Gilead when we can hear from our leadership about their vision for the future and the compounds the company is developing. I also really enjoy hearing patients talk about their experiences and the impact Gilead drugs have had on their lives. The Medical Affairs lecture series, Gilead Talks, Gilead Live, and other forums have also been a really great learning opportunities for me. I hope Gilead continues all of these lecture series/talks because they are absolutely a big part of why I stay excited about our work.

Another great thing about my job here is the development opportunities that I am afforded. My manager has been very supportive of me taking some training courses outside of Gilead to help with specific skill development, and I have been able to take advantage of the tuition reimbursement program. I do wish the tuition reimbursement program was more flexible to include classes that might be beneficial for our jobs but might not necessarily count towards a degree or certificate program. 

Finally, I do really appreciate the benefits here. We have a great 401k matching program, great health insurance, and a relatively generous PTO policy. As always, there are areas for improvement, but I am generally happy with the benefits."
"The relationships that I have acquired. The people at Gilead are outstanding, smart, dedicated and dynamic. I have loved meeting people here and developing/fostering relationships at this company."
"I feel lucky to work with such knowledgeable and dedicated colleagues, both on my study team and inter-departmentally."

"To keep Improving in communications. Within and/or cross functional teams, thorough discussions are always encouraged."
Our group is growing so fast but I am meeting so many people I feel comfortable training and allowing to grow into new responsibilities
"I work with very smart, dedicated people. The people make this job meaningful."

Have the opportunities to involve different projects and tasks.
"I have great management from my direct manager all the way up through Dev Ops. I full empowered to make decisions but I know I have the full support of my management. I also work within a great department, as well as a great cross-functional team environment at my site."
"Club G workout classes, great employee gifts for newly approved drugs, holiday shutdown, Friday Happy Hours, and some of the Gilead events (Gilead Live events/musical performances, Scientific Advisory Board reception, Summer picnic)."

Get to work on things I love and believe is important in Medicine
Having the opportunities to improve upon oneself and the open collaboration with other departments.
"When I joined Kite 3 years ago, I worked with a team of amazing engineers to commercialize a cell therapy process that directly impacted patient's lives. We developed a process with 99% manufacturing success rate, which differentiated Kite from our competitors, and positioned Kite for long term success."
The GMP experience and compliance regulations that allow me to navigate the workday.
Being able to contribute the company mission of saving lives
"I have been able to grow both professionally and personally during my decade plus time at Gilead and throughout it all I feel I have been supported, listened to, and developed."
Being able to work on cutting edge technology that is positively impacting lives.
"My work is engaging and interesting, allowing me to experience many different projects."
My work has a good chance of resulting in clinical compounds and eventually life-saving drugs. Working with people with diverse expertise towards this common goal is the best part.
Management does a great job of being supportive and appreciative of the work we do.
"I feel that my work and efforts are valued and I'm providing an overall contribution to the company goals. I roll up to an organization that strives to value both an individual and collaborative effort. And while it can be difficult, there are efforts to promote a balance at work with group and department events to encourage people to take the time to step away from their desks and work."

N/A
"Different projects, new technology, great people, and we are delivering medicines that help patients."

Working with talented and commited coworkers. Being able to experience and influence all aspects of drug development and the rate at which it proceeds.
Working with dedicated people that aim to win
Dealing with different groups.
The majority of people are excited to be here and be apart of a team environment.
The most rewarding part of my job is knowing that what I do has the possibility to at worst positively impact and at best save some ones life. There is no greater motivation than that to work with the intensity that we do here at Gilead. I have worked at other places where this direct impact felt much further away and so I find myself much more motivated at Gilead to do what it takes to bring new therapies to market.
Being able to work on such a revolutionary therapy and change patients' lives for the better
The opportunities to learn new skills and greater responsibilities is high.
It's great to celebrate Gilead's successes and how we as a company impact people and organizations all over the world. Campus-wide events such as Gilead live and gift distributions celebrating drug approvals are some examples.
"The people I work with in the Commercial organization, as well as in the executive floor are all very caring, committed, hard-working individuals."
The value we bring to patient lives. I personally know people with HIV that use our drugs. The Kite purchase and impact on lives there is also incredible (while limited to date based on patient volume).
I am motivated to work with talented colleagues to pass the mission of Gilead
"I specifically like the teams (my manager, team and peers) that I work with in San Dimas. They are a great group of dedicated people who make a difficult job tolerable."
I work with a great group of individuals who have great work ethic. My team is flexible and works together to learn processes.
"I appreciate the opportunity to work in different departments within Gilead. I started in Research as a PM for Cardiovascular Biology Group as a contractor for 1.5yrs, then I transitioned to a full time position within Comm Mfg dept to learn experiences downstream of the business, getting exposure to product launches and post approval changes working along with my commercial project teams. Finally in 2017, I had to opportunity to transfer to PDM PM to take on development programs and operational excellence CXO management assignments while continuing to support commercial programs. Overall, I get a full view of the product life-cycle from pre-RFD, through Dev activities, and finally commercial change prioritization and launch, working with highly cross-functional teams and having visibility to PDM LT."
"People I work with are the best part of my experience at Gilead. Compared with other places I have worked, Gilead has a high density of type A, highly intelligent, high achievers. This culture is very demanding, but also results in high personal, professional and organizational performance."

The people. I've been fortunate enough to work with some brilliant colleagues who have become friends/mentors/confidants.
knowing we have direct impact on patients lives
Good work culture.
"Being a part of a team that embraces new ideas and being able to put the new ideas into place. I see my work and my team's work creating big ripples and hopefully is creating a workplace that allows the core values of Gilead to be practiced better. Great teamwork created the new conference table standards between space planning and AV to create a clean and functional conference room. Teamwork between the focus group of NB324 and facilities help jumpstart the design for B353VP, which was another collaborative effort between all the departments in Facilities."
"Being a part of a revolutionizing oncology therapy. I respect Gilead for the efforts it makes on less-profiting therapies such as hepatitis issues and aids. I believe I am a part of something bigger and great. Gilead has integrity, and I appreciate that."
"Varied and challenging work opportunities, which allow for professional growth and development, are especially important when promotion to the next level is limited. I have been recognized with opportunities to lead key cross-functional and/or global working groups and leadership responsibilities traditionally not assigned to my department, as well as presented to senior leadership on multiple occasions. This has allowed me to remain satisfied with my Director title for 6 years so that I have not considered Sr. Director employment opportunities elsewhere when they presented themselves."
I feel supported from my manager.
In the years I have been an employee I believe the best part of my experience is the culture of solving complex illnesses and delivering innovative new products to the world. It is rewarding to see the impact we have across the globe with the products we bring to market.
The best part of my experience is seeing the ever evolving changes within our organization in small positive steps. Being part of team that contributes toward a greater cause is important to me.
Working with other teams is a great experience. My peers take a very professional and thorough approach to solving problems.
"Gilead is a very professional, respectful, and humble place to work and the company seems to truly ""walk the talk"" - we really are here to not only serve our investors but more importantly for patients"
My interactions with my external customers and my team.
"The only thing keeping me at Gilead are my co-workers. This role has changed and I wake up most days not wanting to go to work. There have been days that I have left the office, wanting to quit on the spot. If more of my immediate team members leave Gilead, I will likely follow."
That what I do here at work does make a positive difference
"Being part of a solution, particularly in processes or activities that are not optimal."
My work resulted in commercial drug products.
"I'm always learning new things and have the opportunities to challenge myself.
Usually, you are recognized when your effort is above and beyond.
I don't necessarily feel limited by my degree (i.e. I can possibly manage a project despite no PhD)."
admire the company's mission to help Patients
"I have to be honest, the best part of being here for so long are the people. I will say that although I do not feel my career path here has not been what I've wanted for a number of reasons, I've had 5 different roles that were all new, I built foundations for and are existing roles with career paths. It's just unfortunate it has not brought me upward mobility. However, I have an impressive job skill set."
We all contribute in team & we all are motivated. I am honor to have boss like Rita Lai & Daryl Lin & Lynn Navale.
Rudi Ertl is an exceptional leader for the EMEA business - by a long way the best I ever worked with.
"Great products, great people and teams"
"I really enjoy the occasions of, and potential for, utter scientific challenge. No other career path currently offers me the possibility for the same degree of engagement, growth, and fulfillment as R&D in cell therapy largely because of the extent of formidable short- and long-term obstacles to full realization of this technological space, especially in upcoming solid tumor application. In my 1.5 years at Kite, I have of course enjoyed opportunities to help deliver the numerous requests for critical, straightforward experiments and data, and I have certainly always felt acknowledged and appreciated for my contributions. My best experiences, however, have been the few opportunities to lead a more demanding deliverable commensurate with my interest and ability. For example, optimizing and delivering an in-house protocol for high-efficiency research-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout and knock-in compatible with our T-cell expansion method has been a definite highlight. I am eager for still more challenging research opportunities to come."
"Knowing the work we do makes a difference in the world, that we are not simply out for profit but actively working to the betterment of humanity. This is followed closely by the support and effectiveness of my direct manager and by my manager's manager."
Definitely the people at TCFO3 but more than that the Kite Admin. Tech Ops Team.
"The best part of the experience is starting with an account from the ground floor, bringing them to certification, collecting the first patients cells and being there for the final infusion. All of the hard work is rewarded when patients get treated."
Helping make cancer treatment products.
learning and doing new things with challenging timelines drives critical thinking
My best experience is working with my team in MFG under my supervisor. I feel we have a great collaborative energy and are very supportive of one another and with other teams here at Kite during the swing shift. We work well together and it feels very inclusive.
"Ability to take additional HR career development courses, and the tuition reimbursement policy. It is important to continue to offer career development courses and financial education benefits to foster an environment filled with colleagues (especially millennials) eager to grow and better themselves in their careers."
Knowing the impact we have on patient's lives.
Work together as a team; Respect each other; Help each other;
The greatest feeling that our therapy provides cure.
Learning about the field and the work
"The best part of my experience is being able to work with the individuals in the in vivo pharmacaology team at KITE SM led by Gregor Adams. His management style has cultivated a truly collaborative environment where everyone's ideas and concerns are truly heard and where there is complete transparency in what is happening within the group. In this group you are not just involved in the particular project that is listed as your yearly research goals, but you are vested in the data collection and analysis of all the others as well. This gives you a sense of purpose and enhances your ability to grow as a scientist and have a larger picture of how CART are behaving. As my manager he is fully aware of my ability to exceed the responsibilities of my job title and fully understands my hunger to be involved in more of the decision making as it pertains to pipeline programs. He provides me with avenues to explore new ideas as it fits into pipeline work and has fully supported me in career development. He provided me opportunities to present the specificity/selectivity screen of KITE585 at AACR and I was fortunate enough to sit in many meetings relating to bringing in a new therapeutic into an IND submission and continue through clinical studies."
Being a part of saving patients' lives globally through revolutionary science.
Making a difference in our patients lives by curing their disease
Mature systems and processes
Small environment and strong direct teamwork. TCF02 is one of the smaller sites and one benefit to the tight quarters is the sense of community we have.
The people I work with and the collaboration and sharing of knowledge.
"Employee development support (iLearn, HIV Resource Site)
Work/life balance including health and wellness benefits
Commitment to the patients we serve and core values"
I learn a lot. My business partners are mostly very generous with their time and amount of information they provide me to learn as much as I can. I've been provided challenging developmental opportunities. I also feel very impactful as my business partners let me own processes and value my opinions.
Collaborating with colleagues in other groups to ensure priority projects get delivered on time. Work with top talent in those teams
"The CAR-T field encompasses many fields of biological research; such as oncology, immunology, proteomics, molecular biology, and virology. Working in this environment can potentially expose individuals that are new to research to different areas in the field and help to guide them in determining a branch of biology they would like to specialize in. The chance to gain this experience while at the same time contributing toward a cure for cancer is a rare and worthwhile opportunity."
The direction Gilead has chosen for the future. Innovation vs. following others. This keeps me engaged and excited for the future.
"My work could potentially be implemented into the future projects, which will have sustained impact and benefits."
"- the ability to learn from others who have a wealth of experience in ‘pharma’ & community 
- the support employees receive from our directors and teammates"
"I feel very fortunate to have an excellent SRD, RD, and great individuals within my region and also great co-workers (PrEP, CL, HCV) in my territory. I also LOVE my customers. So, “People” is the best part of my experience at Gilead."
Implementation of the business based on the priority
The ability to promote the best in class medications to my customers.
The people I work with are by far the best part of working here. We are an eclectic group that respects one another and we are able to laugh and have fun even during difficult tasks or projects.
The culture. The people here are best in class and exhibit a high level of knowledge and work ethic
Gilead is the most pleasurable work experience I have had. I have a passion for this company and helping patients.
The culture and my colleagues.
Collaborating with others and gaining knowledge from cross functional expertise. Gaining exposer on many therapeutic areas and learning many things in regular basis. Being recognized only when involved in high impact project and some break through takes place.
Learning opportunities
The best part was in the beginning when we were all working for License. All functions had a common goal and we worked together as a team.
Hope that we are making a difference...
"The best part of the experience here is being part of YESCARTA commercial launch. Supporting integrations between KiteKonnect, EBS, Vineti, and Quick to successfully deliver the treatment in-time to the patients."
"This is a very strong execution team. When Gilead wants to conduct a trial, they do it rigorously and efficiently. 

In addition, I believe biostats support is outstanding."
"The best part of working at Kite is making the medicine for the patients. Most of us will work towards getting the medicine made and shipped to the patient as soon as possible. The best part, is hearing the story that the patient received the medicine and the medicine worked."
Gilead provides a competitive salary.
The people with whom I work with directly.
Working as a team with my direct peers. We tend to make calculated decisions rather than knee jerk reactions to solve problems. They all care about their personal performance to achieve the goals given to us. There is pride in completing tasks and projects as I find my direct peers care about what they are involved in (even if it's not something they are excited to do it).
"Being part of the PrEP marketing team, all committed and passionate about HIV Prevention and combating stigma around HIV and PrEP"
Being part of a company that has dramatically changed the lives of countless individuals
Saving patient's life/
The best part of my experience at Gilead is the people that I work with. I am lucky to have good guidance and support from my boss. The Commercial API group is comprised of people who continuously demonstrate their commitment to the five core values. This allows for a better work environment.
"Perspective. Gilead is only the second biotech/pharma company I've worked for, and I left Genentech after 13 years to gain perspective, promotion, and salary increase. I've also learned how to protect myself in a blame oriented environment and use HR as a tool to gain the attention of my management."
The people here strive for excellence and support each other.
I get to learn new skills. My team is very helpful and friendly.
I have been fortunate to be a part of the best group in Kite. My group is very scientifically oriented and is pushing the boundaries of human immunology.
Gilead employs some very bright people
Intelligent people I work with who have thought me several career developing attributes.
Being involved in the launch of new products knowing that it would help a lot of people. Most specifically the launch of Sovaldi.
"I do feel listened to and I have the ability to sell in a style comfortable to me. I am able to think strategically and run my territory as a business.
Curing patients and getting providers to start screening/treating makes my job rewarding"
"The best part of my experience used to be the camaraderie amongst the entire HR team and the desire to fully develop our employees to their highest potential, without bias or judgment and no political or hidden agendas. It never felt siloed and separated but sadly this has been the norm for several years now. So now, the best part of my experience working here today is helping my leaders drive their organizations forward so that we can continue getting our best in class drugs to patients in need all over the world."
"I work with great people who care about their job, work-life balance is manageable, I feel like I'm part of a company who actually makes a difference, and for the most part I feel like the company does care about me as a person."
"There are many opportunities to learn every day at work. People in my department are willing to teach me new techniques, such as new equipment/instrument use and data analysis, as well as help me with my presentation skills (give me feedback whenever I present). I enjoy working on my programs because my teammates are great mentors."
The best part of my experience at Gilead is that I know that I am part of a team that helps in saving many people's lives every day. That's huge satisfaction for me.
"I am allowed to propose and pursue solutions that maybe beneficial to the organization while fulfilling my nominal responsibilities. I appreciate my collaboration with some intelligent co-workers. I appreciate Gilead's policy to make its therapeutics affordable to under-resourced populations. I can discuss ideas scientifically among colleagues that understand and appreciate, the science behind the business."
My coworkers are very talented and extremely diligent about their job responsibilities.
"I appreciatie that i work for a company that places emphasis on a relevant set of core values. As such, I feel that in work in an environment that encourages improvement and as such, does not rest of the status quo. I also appreciate the talented workforce—i have improved in many facets of my professional career by having the opportunity to learn from others."
"Working as part of a team to achieve a common goal. Everyone knows their responsibilities, communicates where they will fall short or reaches out to lend a hand, and executes! This is one of the reasons that has made GILD so successful.."
I am a recent hire. I am impressed with the teamwork as well as the welcoming nature of my new coworkers.
"The people and relationships built and also the foundational HR experience. But, I find myself not certain of how the future of the group is. Despite the larger team, it seems like there's more work being distributed and at the end of the day, there's no room for growth because as FTE employees, we are still thrown into the day to day. Management keeps saying they will take things off our plate to focus on more important things, but it's a constant never ending circle. Hire new and more contractors, then turnover and then have to hire and retrain and the same individuals are given more visibility to senior leadership, while others just get stuck behind the scenes in the day to day."
The passion I see from my co-workers drives my own passion and the sense of fulfillment and contribution when we complete a tough project.
"I enjoy working at Gilead. I enjoy my job. Having transferred departments in the past year, I very much enjoy my current position more that the last one. I feel I am a much better fit in this position and am enjoying myself more and feel I am getting more work done. I work for a great company doing great work for a good cause."
The best part of my experience at Gilead is teamwork amongst the analytical chemistry department and cross-functional teamwork with the commercial API process team. This is particularly evident by collaboration on commercial investigations and supporting transfer of processes to contractors.
I am surrounded by high-caliber scientists who enthusiastically drive progress in our projects and continually question what we are doing and why we are doing it. Their motivation is contagious and inspires me to do my best.
"I am fortunate to work under a leader who does not propagate drama (""politics"") and who is results-oriented and believes in providing opportunity to people who are in search of it. I also have a great team of people under me who are very welcoming of this new leadership style. My immediate working relationships above and below are very healthy, but peers can be a challenge."
Is working with such knowledgeable scientists.
innovation. nimbleness. collaboration.
"The sense of professional and personal pride to work for an organization which has deep focus and high drive in improving patients' lives in areas of unmet medical needs. For example, Gilead's pioneering work in HIV anti-retrovirals has saved a then extremely vulnerable segment of the American population, and improved lives of millions of people living worldwide with HIV."
"Selling the best product for HIV therapy. There are no compromises, unlike with competitors and that is a great feeling and story to convey to customers."
The people and work culture is great. You look forward to come to work everyday.
"The skill set I've acquired. In the 5 years here, I have grown so much within my field. Gilead has provided me with the opportunities needed in order to continue to grow professionally."

"Works as small company but part of a big company (best of both worlds). Safety, security and resources available are wonderful."

I have always had a sense of accomplishment and pride in each day of work because I know that someone is taking a drug product we make and feeling better because of it. I see our commercials for Viread or Emtriva and remember the people I've met in my early work life that were suffering from HIV and HBV with no hope of getting better. I feel closer to the end result in this regard as well as knowing people personally in need. When work seems routine; all I need to do is remember the people I've met that Gilead employees have improved their lives just by doing our jobs - whatever that might be in the organization.
"Working at a manufacturing site, you understand the risks of not being compliant or not following the Gilead core values as it has a potential downstream affect to the patients. The best part of working for this site is that the core values are Gilead way of life, which now become a way of life outside of Gilead. Being surrounded by those that have the same intentions, you tend to take those experiences and teachings and apply to your everyday life outside of Gilead. So in short, Gilead is making me a better me."
"The site support for employee training, learning, and development is the best part of my work experience and knowing that at the same time we make product that saves lives."
Teamwork
"Always something going on, changing scenery, opportunities to develop"
"Being surrounded by extremely intellectual individuals. I feel an immense amount of pride to work alongside my colleagues. There is a palpable depth that Gilead employees possess and I enjoy learning from my colleagues from around the world. 

I truly enjoy the blog posts from our leadership. They are very well written, thoughtful, and poignant. I read every single one and thoroughly enjoy them and they make me strive to work harder/smarter. Thank you for penning these and sharing your thoughts and recognizing the collective contributions that we all make to advance the organizations mission. Please know that your insightful and encouraging words are being heard and received in the manner in which they were written; with appreciation and respect."
